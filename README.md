# MirCleaveNet
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, single-stranded RNAs that play crucial roles in cellular processes and disease progression by regulating gene expression. Accurate prediction of their cleavage sites is essential for understanding miRNA biogenesis, cleavage preferences, and regulatory mechanisms. However, limited studies have focused on predicting Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites, and existing models still exhibit substantial room for improvement. MirCleaveNet combines Gated Bottleneck Convolution (GBC) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) layers, enabling the effective modeling of both local patterns and long-range contextual dependencies. In addition, a High-Similarity-Pass Attention (HSPA) is incorporated to selectively emphasize globally informative contextual features. This architectural synergy significantly enhances the accuracy of cleavage site prediction. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 89 animal species, MirCleaveNet achieves superior performance compared with existing leading approaches. Specifically, it improves the perfect match fraction (PMF) by 6.5%, 1.4%, and 3.5% for cleavage sites at Drosha 5'-arm (DR5), Dicer 5'-arm (DC5), and Dicer 3'-arm (DC3), respectively. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable PMF for Drosha 3'-arm (DR3) sites and reduces the average position shift error (PSE) across all cleavage sites by 0.39 nucleotides. Overall, the results confirm the effectiveness of integrating GBC, Bi-LSTM, and HSPA in improving predictive performance. Moreover, we further evaluated the generalizability of MirCleaveNet by testing it on plant species.
